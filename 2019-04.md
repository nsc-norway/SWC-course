### Setup
You need to bring a (personal/office) laptop (admin rights not necessary) with a wireless network. We will briefly connect the internet but this is not an absolute necessity.

Software setup: Follow the instructions provided [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html)

Mac and Linux users: You will have Bash and Terminal available - so just bring yourself and the laptop.
Windows users: You need to install `Git for Windows[https://gitforwindows.org/]`. Follow the instructions provided [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html) or try the following:

Try installing the [64-bit](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.21.0.windows.1/Git-2.21.0-64-bit.exe) Git for windows. If this fails, try to install the [32-bit](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.21.0.windows.1/Git-2.21.0-32-bit.exe) version.

See you all on Tuesday in XXXX at 0900 hrs!!
